# NOAD ratchet regressed 27 to 32: a British-English pronunciation block renders raw

## Problem

`TestRenderLosesNothingOverLiveEntries` carries a ratchet — a measured count of
live entries that still render unconverted NOAD notation, held at
`knownRawNotationEntries = 27`. Run against the live dictionary it now reports
**32**, and fails:

```
live_property_test.go:127: 32/73502 live entries rendered unconverted NOAD
    notation, up from the known 27 — a regression
```

Two of the three named entries are a shape the ratchet's own comment does not
cover:

```
Brent: unconverted NOAD notation survived, near
  "brent\n\n    | AmE brɛnt, BrE brɛnt | noun (British English) "
brent: (identical)
charge: "…“he charged me”\n    2. euros for the postcard | the restaurant
  charged $15 for dinner | [no obje…"
```

`charge` is the documented cause — *"a prose numeral that happens to continue a
sense sequence is accepted as a sense number"*. `Brent`/`brent` are not: they are
a **dual-pronunciation block**, `| AmE … , BrE … |`, which the renderer leaves in
raw pipe notation.
