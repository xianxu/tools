# LLM seam: Anthropic client, stateful fake, offline degradation

## Problem

Two review forms need judgment a local rule cannot supply: grading a sentence
a person wrote, and confirming that a candidate distractor really is wrong.

## Spec

An LLM seam with a stateful fake.

- Anthropic API behind a narrow interface — one method per task, not a general
  chat call, so each prompt is a testable unit.
- **Degradation is a requirement, not a nicety.** With no key or no network,
  `--play` silently falls back to forms 2.1 and 2.3 (which need neither) rather
  than failing. The learner's review is never blocked on a third party.
- The model's job stays **narrow and checkable**: it verifies or ranks candidates
  that were selected locally (#10, #12); it does not invent the option set.
- Fake records prompts and returns canned completions, so prompt regressions are
  visible in a diff. Live conformance behind the build tag, like every other seam.
- Cost and latency are per-question and user-visible; budget them explicitly.

## Done when

- [ ] `--play` runs a full session with the seam unavailable, using local forms.
- [ ] Every prompt has a fake-backed test; no test hits the live API by default.
- [ ] Structured responses are parsed defensively — a malformed reply degrades to
      "skip this question", never a crash.

## Plan

- [ ] Design via `sdlc start-plan` before implementing.
